title: Foals – Inhaler

Foals in my mind have always been the more mainstream, less challenging little
brother of Youthmovies, and while I follow what Foals do, they will always be
measured on the naught–to–Youthmovies scale.

But Youthmovies are no more, their sound is immutable, so perhaps the
comparisons are unfair to Foals, in the same way that comparing all new
comedies to Faulty Towers, or The Office would be.

But comparisons will be drawn, and in this instance, Foals fail to measure up.

That’s not to say that I don’t like the new sound (if a single song can be any
indication of future direction), but it sounds familiar. Familiar in a 10-year
old sound sort of way. In fact the top Youtube comment hits the nail on the
head:

> Did [Tom Morello][tom_morello] join Foals?

I’ll still listen to “this new Foals”, but most days, I suspect I’d rather have
Youthmovies, and Rage.

Here’s your [35 minutes of Zen][playlist].
